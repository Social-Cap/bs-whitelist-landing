                                <p style={{textAlign: "center"}} className="uk-text-large">SCORPIONS is a revolutionary new DeSci NFT Project with the goal of using biologically sourced peptides to treat inflammation related diseases.</p>
                                <p style={{textAlign: "center"}} className="uk-text-large">The venom of the blue scorpion has been shown to have incredible results in the treatment of medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, autoimmune diseases, and chronic pain.</p>

                            <p className="uk-text-large">More than 50 percent of all deaths globally are attributable to inflammation-related diseases. It is the main cause of a wide range of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, IBS / IBD and neurodegenerative disorders. Chronic inflammation is a major driver of disease, and that targeting inflammation is an effective strategy for preventing and treating many chronic illnesses.</p>
                            <p className="uk-text-large">Some examples of well-known peptides in the human body include insulin, which regulates glucose levels, and growth hormone, which stimulates growth and cell division. Additionally, peptides can also be used as therapeutic agents, such as in the treatment of various diseases and conditions.</p>
                            <p style={{textAlign: "center"}} className="uk-text-large">This means 50% of you, our Founders, can benefit directly from the anti-inflammatory properties of the Blue Scorpion Venom, and close to 100% of all of us have been touched by inflammation related disease from someone in our families or friend groups.</p>
                            <p style={{textAlign: "center"}} className="uk-text-large">Chronic inflammation is thought to contribute to the development of several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and liver cancer. Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Globally, there were an estimated 20 million new cases of cancer and 10 million deaths from cancer in 2023. </p>
                            <p style={{textAlign: "center"}} className="uk-text-large">The cancer burden will increase by approximately 60% over the next two decades, further straining health systems, people and communities. The predicted global burden will increase to <a href='https://www.paho.org/en/campaigns/world-cancer-day-2023-close-care-gap'>about 30 million new cancer cases by 2040</a>, with the greatest increases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Blue Scorpion Venom has proven to work synergistically with current treatments for cancer including chemotherapy, and radiation.</p>
                            <p style={{textAlign: "center"}} className="uk-text-large">We are constantly looking for new modalities that approach solutions to health and healing in a natural and sustainable way. We feel that only by turning to the earth, and it’s natural remedies can we truly promote a lifestyle of health and prosperity.</p>

                            <p className="uk-text-large">Peptides are short chains of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. They are the building blocks of proteins, which are long chains of amino acids. In the human body, peptides play important roles in various physiological processes, including hormone signaling, cellular communication, immune function, and metabolism.</p>
                            <p className="uk-text-large">Some examples of well-known peptides in the human body include insulin, which regulates glucose levels, and growth hormone, which stimulates growth and cell division. Additionally, peptides can also be used as therapeutic agents, such as in the treatment of various diseases and conditions.</p>
                            <p style={{textAlign: "center"}} className="uk-text-large">Our mission at SCORPIONS is to promote the research and development for new peptide-based and biopharmaceutical treatments for inflammation related disease. The venom of the blue scorpion has been shown to have applications in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic pain.

The harvesting of the venom is done in cooperation with the Dominican Government Ministry of Health in a sustainable manner that ensures the preservation of the natural environment, and humane growth of the species.</p>
                            <p style={{textAlign: "center"}} className="uk-text-large">Our social goal at SCORPIONS is to support emerging economies, benefit community enrichment programs, and promote social responsibility in 3rd world countries.
