                            <p className="uk-text-large">Inflammation is a natural response of the body to injury, infection, or cellular damage. During inflammation, various signaling molecules are produced that regulate the immune response. One of these signaling molecules is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is produced through the activity of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. COX-2 is induced in response to various inflammatory stimuli and mediates the production of PGE2, which contributes to pain, fever, and inflammation.</p>
                            <p className="uk-text-large">The activation of COX-2 is regulated by various signaling pathways, including those involving transcription factors, kinases, and other signaling molecules, which are activated in response to inflammation. These signaling pathways trigger the expression of COX-2 and thus contribute to the production of PGE2 and the manifestation of the symptoms of inflammation.</p>
