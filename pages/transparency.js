                        <p>Effective Date: August 8, 2023</p>
                        <p>The following transparency policy outlines the limitations and potential uncertainties associated with the NFT project called SCORPIONS (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"). We believe in fostering transparency and providing our community with clear and honest information about the project's scope, limitations, and potential uncertainties. It is essential to understand the following aspects before engaging in any activities related to the SCORPIONS project.</p>
                        <h3 className="uk-h4 uk-h3@m uk-margin-large-top">Technological Limitations</h3>
                        <p>While SCORPIONS strives to leverage the latest technologies and innovative solutions, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitations and potential technical challenges that may arise. As with any complex technological project, there may be unforeseen technical issues, vulnerabilities, or scalability constraints. We commit to continuously improving our technology and addressing any limitations that arise, but we cannot guarantee the complete absence of technical challenges.</p>
                        <h3 className="uk-h4 uk-h3@m uk-margin-large-top@m">Market and Price Volatility</h3>
                        <p>The value and price of NFTs, including SCORPIONS NFTs, can be highly volatile and subject to fluctuation based on various factors, including market demand, user adoption, and broader market conditions. Investors should be aware that price volatility is a characteristic of the digital asset market, and the value of SCORPIONS NFTs may rise or fall dramatically over short periods. It is important to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.</p>
                        <h3 className="uk-h4 uk-h3@m uk-margin-large-top@m">Regulatory and Legal Considerations</h3>
                        <p>The regulatory landscape surrounding NFTs and digital assets is still evolving and varies across jurisdictions. While we aim to operate within applicable laws and regulations, there may be legal uncertainties or regulatory changes that could impact the project's operations, ownership, or transferability of SCORPIONS NFTs. We encourage users to seek independent legal advice to understand the legal implications and compliance requirements specific to their jurisdiction.</p>
                        <h3 className="uk-h4 uk-h3@m uk-margin-large-top@m">External Dependencies</h3>
                        <p>SCORPIONS may rely on third-party platforms, technologies, or service providers to facilitate certain functions or operations. While we strive to establish reliable partnerships and maintain strong relationships, there may be dependencies beyond our control. External factors such as service disruptions, security breaches, or changes in third-party policies could impact the availability or functionality of the project.</p>
                        <h3 className="uk-h4 uk-h3@m uk-margin-large-top@m">Future Development and Roadmap</h3>
                        <p>Our project's development roadmap and future plans are subject to change based on various factors, including market conditions, technological advancements, and community feedback. While we aim to communicate our intentions and goals transparently, unforeseen circumstances or challenges may necessitate adjustments to the roadmap. We will make reasonable efforts to inform the community of any significant changes or updates to the project's direction.</p>
                        <h3 className="uk-h4 uk-h3@m uk-margin-large-top@m">Community Engagement and Feedback</h3>
                        <p>We value the feedback and contributions of our community members. While we strive to consider community suggestions and address concerns, it is important to acknowledge that we may not be able to accommodate all requests or implement all proposed features. Decisions regarding project development, partnerships, or strategic directions will be made based on careful evaluation and consideration of multiple factors.</p>
                        <h3 className="uk-h4 uk-h3@m uk-margin-large-top@m">Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>Transparency is a core value of the SCORPIONS project. We believe in providing clear and accurate information about the project's limitations and potential uncertainties. By acknowledging these aspects, users and investors can make informed decisions and understand the potential risks associated with their participation in the SCORPIONS project. We commit to maintaining open communication and keeping our community informed of any significant updates or developments that may impact the project.</p>
