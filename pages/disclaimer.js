                        <p>Investing in NFTs and digital assets, including SCORPIONS, involves inherent risks. The value of NFTs can be highly volatile and may fluctuate significantly. Investors should be prepared for the possibility of loss and should only invest funds that they can afford to lose entirely. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee of returns on investments.</p>
                        <h3 className="uk-h4 uk-h3@m uk-margin-large-top@m">Regulatory Considerations</h3>
                        <p>The regulatory landscape surrounding NFTs and digital assets is evolving and varies across jurisdictions. It is crucial for investors to understand and comply with the applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines in their respective jurisdictions. The legal status of NFTs, including their sale, ownership, and taxation, may be subject to change, and investors should seek independent legal advice to ensure compliance.</p>

                        <p>SCORPIONS makes no endorsement or guarantee regarding the future success, profitability, or performance of the project or the value of the associated NFTs. The success of the project depends on various factors, including market conditions, adoption, competition, and regulatory developments. There is no assurance that the project will achieve its intended objectives.</p>
